It is very <span class="adj-btn">unfortunate</span> to pay $ 100 for two <span class="noun-btn">people</span> for this <span class="noun-btn">kind</span> of <span class="noun-btn">buffet</span> when we could have used that <span class="noun-btn">money</span> to dine somewhere with <span class="noun-btn">descent</span> <span class="noun-btn">quality</span> <span class="noun-btn">food</span>. <span class="adj-btn">My</span> <span class="noun-btn">friend</span> was also really <span class="adj-btn">disappointed</span> and plans on writing a <span class="adj-btn">bad</span> <span class="noun-btn">yelp</span> <span class="noun-btn">review</span> because we 've never been at a <span class="noun-btn">buffet</span> in Vegas <span class="adj-btn">that</span> had this <span class="adj-btn">bad</span> <span class="noun-btn">quality</span> of <span class="noun-btn">food</span>. We paid $ 36 per <span class="noun-btn">person</span> and the <span class="noun-btn">food</span> <span class="noun-btn">taste</span> like <span class="adj-btn">cheap</span> <span class="adj-btn">Chinese</span> <span class="noun-btn">buffet</span>.-there was absolutely no <span class="noun-btn">quality</span> in the <span class="noun-btn">food</span>, tasted like any <span class="adj-btn">random</span> <span class="noun-btn">buffet</span> you can eat anywhere It cost over $ 270 for 4 of us so we were expecting <span class="adj-btn">good</span> <span class="noun-btn">food</span> and <span class="noun-btn">service</span>, I had a much <span class="adj-btn">better</span> <span class="noun-btn">buffet</span> <span class="noun-btn">experience</span> at the Rio or Aria for <span class="adj-btn">less</span> <span class="noun-btn">money</span>... Anyway, the <span class="noun-btn">food</span> was cooked so long until it was overlooked and dried out <span class="adj-btn">such</span> as the <span class="noun-btn">dumplings</span>( sprinkled with so <span class="adj-btn">much</span> <span class="noun-btn">salt</span> I 'd swear it was the <span class="noun-btn">pork</span> <span class="noun-btn">belly</span>), fried <span class="noun-btn">chicken</span>, <span class="noun-btn">beef</span> at <span class="noun-btn">cutting</span> <span class="noun-btn">station</span>, <span class="adj-btn">horrible</span> <span class="noun-btn">jerk</span> <span class="noun-btn">chicken</span>, <span class="noun-btn">chicken</span> over <span class="noun-btn">rice</span> with <span class="noun-btn">peanuts</span>. I tried the <span class="noun-btn">mushy</span> <span class="adj-btn">angry</span> <span class="noun-btn">mac</span> & <span class="noun-btn">cheese</span>, <span class="adj-btn">terrible</span> <span class="adj-btn">faux</span> <span class="noun-btn">sushi</span>; snatched from me while plating and he thought it was <span class="adj-btn">funny</span> but the <span class="noun-btn">jokes</span> on you because you have lost <span class="adj-btn">my</span> <span class="noun-btn">family</span> as <span class="noun-btn">customers</span>. I wish i went to Caesars Palace <span class="noun-btn">buffet</span> before leaving Vegas I do n't mind paying the <span class="adj-btn">extra</span> $ 15-$20 if <span class="adj-btn">its</span> <span class="adj-btn">better</span> <span class="noun-btn">quality</span> <span class="noun-btn">food</span>. <span class="noun-btn">Food</span> <span class="noun-btn">quality</span> is <span class="adj-btn">average</span> like <span class="adj-btn">most</span> <span class="adj-btn">other</span> <span class="noun-btn">buffets</span> in <span class="noun-btn">vegas</span> but I do n't think this <span class="noun-btn">place</span> is <span class="adj-btn">worth</span> the <span class="noun-btn">price</span> and wait. This <span class="noun-btn">place</span> is <span class="adj-btn">terrible</span> the <span class="noun-btn">food</span> is not <span class="adj-btn">good</span> <span class="adj-btn">small</span> <span class="noun-btn">selection</span> <span class="noun-btn">service</span> is not <span class="adj-btn">great</span> there 's not a <span class="noun-btn">lot</span> of <span class="noun-btn">seafood</span> for the <span class="noun-btn">price</span> it 's not <span class="adj-btn">worth</span> that I do not recommend <span class="noun-btn">anybody</span> coming here I 'm <span class="adj-btn">glad</span> I tried it but I rather go to Caesar 's <span class="noun-btn">buffet</span> <span class="adj-btn">My</span> <span class="noun-btn">husband</span> and I decided to make this <span class="adj-btn">our</span> <span class="adj-btn">last</span> <span class="noun-btn">meal</span> <span class="noun-btn">stop</span> before heading home from <span class="adj-btn">our</span> <span class="noun-btn">vacation</span>.
